# Albator Swift GUI - Project Documentation

## ðŸ“± Swift GUI Migration Assessment for Albator macOS Security Tool

This document provides a comprehensive assessment of migrating the existing Python-based Albator security tool to a native Swift macOS application with a modern GUI.

## ðŸ“‚ Documentation Structure

- `README.md` - This overview document
- `project-analysis.md` - Current codebase analysis (22,841 LOC breakdown)
- `technical-requirements.md` - Technical specifications and requirements
- `architecture-design.md` - Proposed Swift app architecture  
- `development-plan.md` - Development timeline and resource planning ($532,398 estimate)
- `ui-ux-design.md` - User interface and experience design
- `mermaid-charts-overview.md` - Index of all 21 visual diagrams

## ðŸŽ¯ Executive Summary

**Current State:**
- Python codebase: 39 files, ~22,841 lines of code
- Comprehensive security features: network scanning, compliance checking, vulnerability assessment
- CLI and web interfaces available

**Proposed Swift App:**
- Native macOS application with SwiftUI/AppKit
- Modern GUI with rich interactions
- Full feature parity with Python version
- Enhanced user experience and performance

**Development Estimate:**
- **Timeline:** 6-8 months (32 weeks)
- **Team:** 2-3 experienced developers + UI/UX designer + QA engineer
- **Cost:** $532,398 total (detailed breakdown in development-plan.md)

**Key Features:**
- Network security scanning with real-time results
- Multi-framework compliance checking (NIST 800-53, CIS macOS, SOC2)
- Comprehensive vulnerability assessment with CVE integration
- Rich data visualization and reporting capabilities
- Native macOS integration with proper entitlements and permissions

## ðŸ“Š Visual Documentation

All documentation includes comprehensive **Mermaid charts** for visual understanding:

- **Architecture diagrams** showing component relationships and data flow
- **Workflow sequences** illustrating user interactions and system processes  
- **Timeline charts** for development planning and milestone tracking
- **Cost breakdowns** and risk assessment visualizations
- **User journey maps** and accessibility flows

See [`mermaid-charts-overview.md`](./mermaid-charts-overview.md) for a complete index of all 21 charts included in the documentation.
