## ðŸŽ¨ Chart Color Coding

The charts use consistent color coding to help identify different types of components:

- **ðŸ”µ Blue (#e3f2fd)** - UI/Presentation components
- **ðŸŸ¢ Green (#e8f5e8)** - Core business logic and security features  
- **ðŸŸ  Orange (#fff3e0)** - Data and persistence layers
- **ðŸŸ£ Purple (#f3e5f5)** - Configuration and management features
- **ðŸ”´ Red (#ffebee)** - Security and testing components

## ðŸ“‹ Chart Usage Guidelines

### For Developers
- Use architecture diagrams to understand component relationships
- Reference workflow diagrams during implementation
- Consult dependency flows for migration planning

### For Project Managers
- Use timeline and cost charts for planning and tracking
- Reference risk matrices for mitigation planning
- Use milestone timelines for stakeholder communication

### For Designers
- Use information architecture for navigation design
- Reference user journey maps for workflow optimization
- Consult accessibility flows for inclusive design

### For Stakeholders
- Use cost breakdowns for budget approval
- Reference milestone timelines for delivery expectations
- Consult risk assessments for project confidence

## ðŸ”„ Updating Charts

When updating the documentation:

1. **Maintain Consistency** - Use the established color scheme and styling
2. **Update Cross-References** - Ensure chart content matches text descriptions
3. **Version Control** - Document significant changes to chart structure
4. **Validation** - Test that Mermaid syntax renders correctly
