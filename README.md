# 🛡️ Albator - macOS Security Hardening Framework

> **Defensive Security Tool for macOS System Hardening and Compliance**

Albator is a comprehensive security hardening framework designed to enhance macOS security posture through automated configuration management, compliance checking, and vulnerability assessment.

## 🎯 Project Overview

**Current Implementation:**
- **Python Framework** with 39 files and 22,841 lines of defensive security code
- **Multi-Framework Compliance** checking (NIST 800-53, CIS macOS, SOC2)
- **Network Security Scanning** with port scanning and service detection
- **Vulnerability Assessment** with CVE integration and risk scoring
- **Configuration Management** with profile inheritance and rollback capabilities

**Future Development:**
- **Swift GUI Application** for native macOS integration
- **Professional Interface** with rich data visualization
- **Enhanced User Experience** with accessibility features

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Current Python Framework

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd macoshardening

# Set up the environment
cd MACOS_HARDENING
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh

# Run basic security assessment
./albator.sh --scan

# Run comprehensive analysis
python albator_cli.py --comprehensive-scan
```

### Documentation

```bash
# Explore Swift migration documentation
cd albator-swift/
open README.md

# View visual architecture diagrams
open mermaid-charts-overview.md
```

## 🔒 Security Principles

This project follows **defensive security principles**:

- ✅ **Legitimate hardening** capabilities only
- ✅ **System protection** and vulnerability remediation
- ✅ **Compliance frameworks** (NIST, CIS, SOC2)
- ✅ **Audit logging** and change tracking
- ✅ **Rollback capabilities** for safe configuration changes
- ❌ **No offensive** or malicious capabilities

## 📈 Development Roadmap

### Current Status: Python Framework ✅
- Comprehensive security hardening capabilities
- Advanced scanning and compliance checking
- Professional logging and configuration management

### Next Phase: Swift GUI Development 📋
- **Timeline:** 6-8 months (32 weeks)
- **Budget:** $532,398 total development cost
- **Team:** 2-3 developers + UI/UX designer + QA engineer
- **Deliverable:** Native macOS application with rich GUI
