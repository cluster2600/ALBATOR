This guide is a collection of techniques for improving the security and privacy of [Apple silicon](https://support.apple.com/116943) Mac computers running a [currently supported](https://support.apple.com/HT201222) version of macOS 15 (Sequoia). **Using Macs with Intel CPUs leaves you open to [security vulnerabilities](https://github.com/axi0mX/ipwndfu?tab%253Dreadme-ov-file#checkm8) on the hardware level that Apple can't patch**. Apple silicon Macs are the minimum recommendation, but as a general rule, newer chips are always more secure.

This guide is targeted to power users who wish to adopt enterprise-standard security, but is also suitable for novice users with an interest in improving their privacy and security on a Mac.

If you're securing computers for an organization, use the [official NIST guidelines for macOS](https://github.com/usnistgov/macos_security).

A system is only as secure as its administrator is capable of making it. There is no one single technology, software, nor technique to guarantee perfect computer security; a modern operating system and computer is very complex, and requires numerous incremental changes to meaningfully improve one's security and privacy posture.

This guide is provided on an 'as is' basis without any warranties of any kind. Only **you** are responsible if you break anything or get in any sort of trouble by following this guide.

# Basics

General security best practices apply:

- Create a [threat model](#threat-modeling)
  * What are you trying to protect and from whom? Is your adversary a three letter agency, a nosy eavesdropper on the network, or a determined [APT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat) orchestrating a campaign against you?
  * Recognize threats and how to reduce attack surface against them.

- Keep the system and software up to date
  * Patch the operating system and all installed software regularly.
  * macOS system updates can be completed in the [settings](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/keep-your-mac-up-to-date-mchlpx1065) and set to automatically install. You can also use the `softwareupdate` command-line utility - neither requires registering an Apple account.
  * Subscribe to announcement mailing lists like [Apple security-announce](https://lists.apple.com/mailman/listinfo/security-announce).

- Encrypt sensitive data
  * In addition to [FileVault](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/protect-data-on-your-mac-with-filevault-mh11785) volume encryption, consider using the [built-in password manager](https://support.apple.com/105115) to protect passwords and other sensitive data.

- Assure data availability
  * Create [regular backups](https://support.apple.com/104984) of your data and be ready to [restore from a backup](https://support.apple.com/102551) in case of compromise.
  * [Encrypt locally](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/keep-your-time-machine-backup-disk-secure-mh21241) before copying backups to unencrypted external media or the "cloud"; alternatively, enable [end-to-end encryption](https://support.apple.com/guide/security/advanced-data-protection-for-icloud-sec973254c5f) if your cloud provider supports it.
  * Verify backups by accessing them regularly.

- Click carefully
  * Ultimately, the security of a system depends on the capabilities of its administrator.
  * Care should be taken when installing new software; only install from official sources that the developers indicate on their official website/github/etc.

# Threat modeling

The first and most important step for security and privacy is to create a [threat model](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Application_Threat_Modeling). You need to understand your adversaries in order to defend against them. Each person will have their own needs so everyone's threat model will be different. Threat models tend to evolve over time as our situation changes, so be sure to periodically reassess your threat model.

## Identify assets

This is probably a lot of things: your phone, your laptop, passwords stored on your devices, internet browsing history, etc. Make a list starting with the most important assets to protect. You can put them in categories based on how important they are: public, sensitive, or secret.

## Identify adversaries

Define whom you are defending against. Start by defining the motivation they might have to attack your assets. [Financial gain](https://www.verizon.com/business/resources/reports/dbir/) is a big motivator for many attackers, for example.

## Identify capabilities

In order to counter your adversaries, you'll need to understand what they're capable of and what they're not capable of. Rank adversaries from totally unsophisticated to very advanced. For example, a common thief is not very sophisticated; they will likely be stopped by basic things like simply having a password and drive encryption on your device. A very advanced adversary like a state actor might require fully turning off your device when not in use to clear the keys from RAM and a long diceware password.

## Identify mitigations

Now is when you decide the best way to counter each threat. You might avoid writing passwords down on paper so your roommate can't find them or you might encrypt the drive on your computer so a thief can't get data from it. It's important to balance security and usability; every mitigation should counter some capability of your adversaries, otherwise you might be making your life inconvenient for little to no gain. If you can't think of any more capabilities your adversaries might have and you've implemented mitigations for them all, your work is done.

Here's an example of the type of table you should make for each asset you want to protect:

Adversary | Motivation | Capabilities | Mitigation
-|-|-|-
Roommate | See private chats or browsing history | Close proximity; can see screen or watch type in password | Use biometrics, use privacy screen, keep phone locked when not using it
Thief | Unlock phone and steal personal info and drain bank accounts, sell phone for money | Shoulder surf to see password, steal device when not looking while it's logged in | Keep phone in sight or on person at all times, keep locked when not in use, use biometrics to avoid typing passwords
Sophisticated adversary (state actor) | See private messages to detect dissent | Compromise firmware, potentially install keylogger, listen in with microphone or camera | Use only hardware you can trust, use end-to-end encrypted messaging, use trusted VPN or Tor when communicating

# Hardware

Start with the assumption that hardware, firmware and lower levels of your device are compromised. Consider using a separate computer for sensitive or secret work that never leaves your home and remains powered off when not in use.

Apple silicon Mac devices have a number of hardware security features built in. Secure Enclave is a dedicated chip that provides additional encryption for passwords and other private data. Newer devices also have an Apple-designed T2 chip, which provides additional security features including secure boot and encrypted storage.

# Installing macOS

It is recommended to install macOS from scratch rather than upgrade from a previous version. Doing this ensures that the system is in a known good state and helps avoid potential issues from older configurations.

To get started, you need to obtain a copy of the latest macOS installer. This can be downloaded directly from the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/story/id1527743152354257857?src=changeRegion&region=us).

1. **Create a bootable installer:** Use the `createinstallmedia` command to make a bootable USB installer.
2. **Erase and format the drive:** Boot into Recovery Mode (hold Command-R during startup) and use Disk Utility to erase the drive and format it as APFS.
3. **Install macOS:** Use the bootable installer to install a fresh copy of macOS.

## System activation

During the initial setup, you will be asked to activate your Mac. This step is necessary to use many features of macOS, but you can skip the creation of an Apple ID account by choosing "Set Up Later."

## Apple ID

While you can use macOS without an Apple ID, many features like iCloud, App Store, and Find My Mac require one. It is recommended to use a separate Apple ID for each device if possible, to minimize the impact of a compromised account.

## App Store

The Mac App Store is a secure place to download and install apps. However, not all apps are available through the App Store. Be cautious when downloading software from the web; verify the integrity of the software by checking its digital signature when possible.

## Virtualization

Consider using virtualization tools like Parallels Desktop or VMware Fusion to create isolated environments for running untrusted software. Virtual machines can provide an additional layer of security by sandboxing applications from your main system.

# First boot

After installing macOS, it's important to go through the initial setup carefully. Pay close attention to the privacy and security settings and adjust them according to your threat model.

- **Network settings:** Connect to a secure and trusted network.
- **Location Services:** Disable if not needed, as it can reveal your location.
- **Analytics:** Disable sharing analytics with Apple and app developers to limit data exposure.
- **Screen Time:** Enable and configure Screen Time to monitor and limit device usage.

# Admin and user accounts

macOS requires an administrator account to manage the system. However, it is recommended to create a separate standard user account for daily use to minimize the risk of accidentally making harmful changes to the system.

## Caveats

- **Avoid using the root account:** macOS disables the root account by default. If you need to perform administrative tasks, use the `sudo` command.
- **Limit the number of admin accounts:** Only create additional admin accounts if absolutely necessary.

## Setup

1. **Create a standard user account:** During the initial setup, create an administrator account, then create a standard user account for daily use.
2. **Disable automatic login:** Go to System Preferences > Users & Groups > Login Options and disable automatic login.
3. **Enable fast user switching:** This allows you to quickly switch between user accounts without logging out.

# Firmware

Ensure your Mac's firmware is up to date. Apple regularly releases firmware updates that include security patches and improvements.

1. **Check for updates:** Go to System Preferences > Software Update to check for and install any available updates.
2. **EFI security:** Consider enabling EFI password protection to prevent unauthorized access to your Mac's firmware settings.

# FileVault

FileVault is a built-in encryption feature that protects your data by encrypting the entire drive. It is highly recommended to enable FileVault to secure your data in case your Mac is lost or stolen.

1. **Enable FileVault:** Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > FileVault and follow the instructions to enable it.
2. **Recovery key:** Store your recovery key in a safe place. Do not store it on your Mac.

# Lockdown Mode

Lockdown Mode is a new security feature in macOS 15 (Sequoia) that provides an additional layer of protection by restricting certain features and network connections. This mode is designed for high-risk individuals who are targeted by sophisticated cyber attacks.

1. **Enable Lockdown Mode:** Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Lockdown Mode and follow the instructions to enable it.
2. **Customize settings:** Adjust the settings according to your threat model and needs.

# Firewall

A firewall is a critical component of your Mac's security. It helps block unauthorized access to your system and can prevent malware from communicating with its command and control servers.

## Application layer firewall

macOS includes a built-in application layer firewall that allows you to control which applications can accept incoming connections.

1. **Enable the firewall:** Go to System Preferences > Security & Privacy > Firewall and turn it on.
2. **Configure settings:** Click on Firewall Options to customize the firewall settings. You can add or remove applications and services that are allowed to accept incoming connections.
