# Deprecations

## Active Deprecations

- `albator_cli.py legacy ...`: legacy baseline flow is still supported but marked for future removal in a major release.
- `tests/test_framework.py --include-scripts`: deprecated alias for `--include-mutating`.

## Migration Path

- Prefer `python3 albator_cli.py <command>` over legacy orchestration paths.
- Use `python3 tests/test_framework.py --include-mutating` instead of `--include-scripts`.
- Use `python3 rollback_apply.py <rollback.json> --json` to execute rollback metadata generated by shell scripts.

## Compatibility Window

Deprecations announced here are expected to remain functional through the current major version unless otherwise noted in `CHANGELOG.md`.
